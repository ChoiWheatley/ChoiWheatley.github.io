# Introduction

Hi, my name is Choi Wheatley(ìµœìŠ¹í˜„). I'm a junior backend developer looking for better understanding of programming paradigms, computer knowledgements, agile cultures.

I'm highly interested in knowledge making process. I have a pipeline from casting idea to archiving for further retrieval. With [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), I can create notes with hyperlinks!

I'm native Korean, but I can understand English at reading, listening.

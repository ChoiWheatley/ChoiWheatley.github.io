title: abstract data type과 interface의 차이
---
An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a purely theoretical entity that bundles data with a set of related operations². It behaves in the same way as a built-in type does². However, it does not inherit from other classes, nor does it serve as the base for other derived classes².

On the other hand, an **interface** is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement¹. It can only have constants and method stubs¹. An interface cannot contain data fields³.

In summary, an ADT defines a data structure with a set of operations, while an interface defines a set of methods that a class must implement. Would you like more information on this topic?

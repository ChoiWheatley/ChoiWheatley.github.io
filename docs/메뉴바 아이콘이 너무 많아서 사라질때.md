## [Hidden preference to alter the menubar spacing](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/16lpfg5/hidden_preference_to_alter_the_menubar_spacing/)

메뉴바 아이콘 사이의 공간을 조절할 수 있다고 한다!

```
defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain NSStatusItemSpacing -int $X
defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain NSStatusItemSelectionPadding -int $Y
```

`X`: 12, `Y`: 6 정도가 적당한듯

되돌리려면,

```
defaults -currentHost delete -globalDomain NSStatusItemSpacing
defaults -currentHost delete -globalDomain NSStatusItemSelectionPadding
```

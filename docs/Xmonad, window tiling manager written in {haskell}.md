# TODO

- [ ] [replace xmobar with rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
- [ ] keyboard settings(currently I cannot use hangul...)
- [ ] trackpad settings(mouse speed, scroll orientation)
- [ ] 
- [ ] [Xmonad.Prompt.Window](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.17.0/docs/XMonad-Prompt-Window.html) can search window, not app

# Deeply related to X window server...

[[system-config-.... {x-window}]]

We have to config everything that relates to x window server such as trackpad settings, language and keyboards, etc

I feel insecure not using any gui-based system settings............. :cry: :cry

### 🏃 오늘의 운동

선유도 한바퀴 걷기

### 🌞 오늘은...

정상인 생활패턴으로 돌리자. 건강한 신체와 건강한 정신이 항상 우선이다.

### 🌜 어제는...

[[Xmonad, window tiling manager written in {haskell}|xmonad]]를 위한 [[haskell λ=]]공부를 하다가 neovim 세팅으로 옮겨갔고, LSP 세팅에 빠져서 많은 시간을 쏟았다.

### ⏰ Daily Routine

### 🚀 WHY, HOW, WHAT

> 오늘 하루의 동기를 다시 생각해보는 시간을 가져봅시다. 오늘의 신념, 목표를 달성하기 위한 방법, 오늘의 성과에 대해서 작성해봅시다.

다시 생산성 높은 최승현으로, 도파민 균형을 위해 당분과 SNS를 최소화하는 최승현으로 바꾸자.

##  🪂 PARA

~~GPT한테 작성해달라고 요청했다.~~

### **Projects**

1. **Prepare Tomorrow's Project Meeting (Portfolio Web Application)**
   - Goal: Begin the new portfolio project for your backend web developer resume.
   - Tasks:
     - Brainstorm ideas for the web application.
     - Set prior rules: meeting duration, frequency.
2. **"Giftogether" Project** (Web application for collaborative gifting)
   - Goal: Work on Docker integration.
   - Tasks:
     - Track down what you have done to run `Dockerfile.development` and `docker-compose.development.yml` on Linux, macOS, and identify why it doesn’t work on Windows.
     - Introduce multi-stage Docker builds.
     - Push Docker images to a registry (e.g., AWS ECR).
     - *Note for Later*: Consider introducing continuous delivery; I’ll remind you after the current steps are completed.
  

### **Areas**

1. **Learning Docker**
   - Goal: Continue the Docker dependency and health check chapter.
   - Note: This chapter might take some time due to your prior study habits. No rush here, pace yourself effectively.
2. **Change of Address Registration (전입신고)**
   - Task: Visit 정부24.com to register the address change.
   - Note: This is time-insensitive, so it can be done whenever you have a free moment.
3. **Tax Payment**
   - Task: Check and pay your taxes via [Hana Bank](https://my.hanabank.com/nSSnFUAQ).

### **Resources**

1. **Domain Expiration Notice**
   - Context: Gabia notified you about the expiration of the domain `choiwheatley.store`.
   - Task: Erase the domain since you are not currently using it.

### **Archive**

1. **Completed Tiny Tasks**
   - **Sent Message to Coworker**: You successfully asked them to move the meeting time to avoid overlapping with another schedule.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Start by focusing on the "Prepare Tomorrow's Project Meeting" tasks, as this is your main goal for today.
- For the "Giftogether" project, ensure the Docker setup is running correctly on all platforms—addressing the Windows issue could be next in line.
- During any spare time, work on the Docker chapter and the time-insensitive tasks like changing your address or erasing the domain.

##  🪂 PARA

#### **Projects**

1. **"Giftogether" Project**
   - Focus on:
     - Introduce multi-stage Docker builds.
     - Push Docker images to a registry (e.g., AWS ECR).
   - Reminder: The meeting is now **tomorrow at 14:00**. Make sure any prep is finalized by then.

#### **Areas**

1. **Tax Payment**
   - Check and pay your taxes via [Hana Bank](https://my.hanabank.com/nSSnFUAQ).

2. **Change of Address Registration (전입신고)**
   - Task: Visit 정부24.com to register your new address.
   - Note: This is time-insensitive, so you can decide to do it today if you have some extra time.

#### **Resources**

1. **Learning Docker**
   - Continue on the chapter about Docker dependencies and health checks.
   - Since today is more relaxed, you could spend a bit of time on this to build your understanding for future work.

#### **Next Steps**

- **Priority 1**: Continue with **"Giftogether" Project** tasks—Docker multi-stage builds and pushing to the registry. This is your main project right now.
- **Priority 2**: Address the **Tax Payment** task if possible to clear it off your list.
- **Priority 3**: Spend time learning Docker or do **Change of Address Registration** if you feel productive.

Here is a summary of the page in Microsoft Edge:

- **Motivation**: The feature was motivated by the need to avoid code duplication and improve performance for member functions that need to handle different const/volatile/reference qualifiers of the object they are called on, such as std::optional::value.
- [**Design**: The feature follows the principle of doing what the user expects, and does not change the existing rules of overload resolution, template deduction, or name resolution](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/chat?udsframed=1&form=SHORUN&clientscopes=chat,noheader,udsedgeshop,channelstable,wincopilot,ntpquery,udsinwin11,udsdlpconsent,&shellsig=a195b9e450b2877bd3f359162004345394ec7a74&setlang=en-US&lightschemeovr=1#sjevt%7CDiscover.Chat.SydneyClickPageCitation%7Cadpclick%7C1%7Cf863cd2d-b94c-4518-9713-33e862ba2b9b%7C%7B%22sourceAttributions%22%3A%7B%22providerDisplayName%22%3A%22Notably%2C%20w...%22%2C%22pageType%22%3A%22html%22%2C%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22relatedPageUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fdevblogs.microsoft.com%252Fcppblog%252Fcpp23-deducing-this%252F%22%2C%22lineIndex%22%3A103%2C%22highlightText%22%3A%22Notably%2C%20we%20didn%E2%80%99t%20touch%20overload%20resolution%20rules%20or%20template%20deduction%20rules%2C%20and%20name%20resolution%20was%20only%20changed%20a%20little%20bit%20(as%20a%20treat).%22%2C%22snippets%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%7D)[2](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/chat?udsframed=1&form=SHORUN&clientscopes=chat,noheader,udsedgeshop,channelstable,wincopilot,ntpquery,udsinwin11,udsdlpconsent,&shellsig=a195b9e450b2877bd3f359162004345394ec7a74&setlang=en-US&lightschemeovr=1#sjevt%7CDiscover.Chat.SydneyClickPageCitation%7Cadpclick%7C1%7Cf863cd2d-b94c-4518-9713-33e862ba2b9b%7C%7B%22sourceAttributions%22%3A%7B%22providerDisplayName%22%3A%22Notably%2C%20w...%22%2C%22pageType%22%3A%22html%22%2C%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22relatedPageUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fdevblogs.microsoft.com%252Fcppblog%252Fcpp23-deducing-this%252F%22%2C%22lineIndex%22%3A103%2C%22highlightText%22%3A%22Notably%2C%20we%20didn%E2%80%99t%20touch%20overload%20resolution%20rules%20or%20template%20deduction%20rules%2C%20and%20name%20resolution%20was%20only%20changed%20a%20little%20bit%20(as%20a%20treat).%22%2C%22snippets%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%7D).

> how much space can plm4 (page map level 4) cover? give me a detailed formula

## answer from bing chat

PLM4 stands for Page Map Level 4, which is a paging structure used in long mode (64-bit) by x86-64 processorsÂ¹. It is the highest level of the four-level page table system, and it contains 512 entries that point to the Page-Directory Pointer Tables (PDPTs)Â².

The size of a page depends on the processor mode, the extensions used, and the virtual address bits supported by the processorÂ². In long mode, the page size can be 4 KiB, 2 MiB, or 1 GiBÂ². The space that PLM4 can cover depends on the page size and the number of entries used.

The formula for calculating the space covered by PLM4 is:

$$
\text{Space} = \text{Page Size} \times \text{Number of PDPTs} \times 512 \times 512
$$

where:

- Page Size is either 4 KiB, 2 MiB, or 1 GiB
- Number of PDPTs is the number of entries in PLM4 that are used (from 1 to 512)

For example, if we use 4 KiB pages and all 512 entries in PLM4, then the space covered by PLM4 is:

$$
\text{Space} = 4 \text{ KiB} \times 512 \times 512 \times 512 = 1 \text{ TiB}
$$

If we use 2 MiB pages and only one entry in PLM4, then the space covered by PLM4 is:

$$
\text{Space} = 2 \text{ MiB} \times 1 \times 512 \times 512 = 512 \text{ GiB}
$$

If we use 1 GiB pages and only one entry in PLM4, then the space covered by PLM4 is:

$$
\text{Space} = 1 \text{ GiB} \times 1 \times 512 \times 512 = 256 \text{ TiB}
$$

I hope this helps you understand how much space PLM4 can cover. ðŸ˜Š

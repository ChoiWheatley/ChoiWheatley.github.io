The key difference between installing dependencies via `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` lies in how the dependencies are resolved and the versions of the packages that are installed.

---

### 1. **Installing via `poetry.lock`**

- **Purpose:** Uses exact versions of dependencies that were already resolved and locked in the `poetry.lock` file.
- **Behavior:**
  - Installs the exact versions of dependencies specified in the `poetry.lock` file.
  - No dependency resolution is performed.
  - Ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, as the locked versions are guaranteed.
- **Use Case:**
  - Ideal for production or CI/CD environments where you want to ensure that the exact same dependencies are installed as tested.
  - Reproducible builds are critical.

### 2. **Installing via `pyproject.toml`**

- **Purpose:** Resolves dependencies based on the constraints defined in the `pyproject.toml` file.
- **Behavior:**
  - Poetry resolves dependency versions according to the specified version ranges.
  - May install newer versions of dependencies if updates are available within the specified constraints (e.g., `^1.0` can allow `1.1` or `1.2`).
  - A new `poetry.lock` file will be generated or updated to reflect the resolved versions.
- **Use Case:**
  - Ideal during development or when you want to update dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
  - Useful when adding or changing dependencies in the project.

### Summary of Differences

| **Aspect**                | **`poetry.lock`**                                | **`pyproject.toml`**                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Dependency Resolution** | None (uses locked versions)                     | Resolves dependencies based on constraints |
| **Reproducibility**       | High (ensures identical versions)               | May vary (depends on available versions)   |
| **Speed**                 | Faster (no resolution step)                     | Slower (due to dependency resolution)      |
| **Use Case**              | Consistent environments (e.g., production)      | Updating or modifying dependencies         |
| **Output**                | Installs from `poetry.lock`                     | Updates `poetry.lock` with new resolutions |

### Best Practices

1. **For Development:** Use `pyproject.toml` to modify and resolve dependencies during active development.
2. **For Production/CI/CD:** Use `poetry.lock` to ensure consistent, predictable dependency versions across environments. 

By leveraging these files appropriately, you can maintain flexibility in development while ensuring stability in production.
